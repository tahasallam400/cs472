/*
The overall page has a background color of #CCCCFF. The preferred font for all text on the page is the default
sans-serif font available on the system, in size 14pt, in bold.
The top of the page contains a heading in 32pt bold text, centered horizontally within the page. There is no margin
between the heading content area and other neighboring content on the page.
Under the page's heading is a text box with 80 columns and 20 rows, centered horizontally. Its width is 90% of the
page size and height is 400px. It uses a 12pt bold monospace font initially. CSS width/height properties will set the
text box's size, but you must put rows/cols attributes in your textarea HTML element for the page to validate.
Below the text box is a set of controls grouped into several field sets, each with a 5px black border around it and a
label on top. Their behavior is described below. To get the field sets to appear in a row horizontally, see textbook
Chapter 4's section about Element Visibility and the display property. You should make sure that the tops of the
field sets line up by setting their vertical alignment. The text area and control field sets are centered horizontally.
